    "### i) Topic Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into details on HDP, it is helpful to provide some general background on topic modeling and related methods.  Topic modeling refers to the set of unsupervised techniques used to analyze text data in documents (corpus) and determine clusters of words (topics). These methods are commonly implemented in settings requiring grouping documents based on text similarity or exploring non-apparent trends in text data. For example, auto-tagging customer support tickets based the textual similarity to previous tickets or gathering underlying trends from open-ended questions in customer feedback that could inform product features. Therefore, common results from topic modeling include 1) a set of topics and 2) a set of documents grouped by topics. However, it is important to note that these methods treat text data in a bag-of-words representation which ignores syntactic and semantic information. Similarly, they require lots of high-quality data (i.e. pre-cleaned text) for them to be most effective. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand HPDs, it is important to start with a general understanding of base topic modeling algorithms such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).$^{2,3}$ These methods have two main underlying assumptions when it comes to modeling text. The first is that similar topics will use similar words (i.e. each topic will have a distribution over words), and the second is that documents talk about multiple topics (i.e. document can be thought as a mixture of topics). However, there exists one main difference between LSA and LDA. LSA doesn’t assume topics are distributed according to a specific distribution, while LDA offers a probabilistic approach and assumes the topics are Dirichlet distributed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a plate representation of an LDA model. Here $D$ is a set of documents and $N$ is the number of words within each document. The main idea is that for each document $d$ we have a set of topics ($\\theta_d$) and we assigns topics($z_{d,n}$) to those words ($w_{d,n}$). The parameter $\\alpha$ controls how many topics are assigned to documents, while $\\eta$ controls how many words are assigned to topic\n",

    "Dirichlet Process Mixtures (DPMs) can be thought of as an extension to LDA in that, instead of predefining topics, these are inferred from the data (non-parametric) and can be thought as coming from an infinite distribution of topics. This last statement is only possible due thanks to something called Dirichlet Processes (DPs). \n",

This infinitely discrete property arises from first generating samples from a continuous base distribution (e.g. a Gaussian), which can take an infinite number of forms, before these are realized as discrete when we assign weights to these samples. The result is an infinitely discrete distribution that follows a Dirichlet distribution.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "A common, and sometimes helpful analogy, to DPMs is that of a Chinese Restaurant Process. We imagine a restaurant that serves dishes (topics) from an infinite menu (set of topics) and has space for infinite tables (word clusters). Each table can only be served one dish from the menu, but dishes can be repeated among tables. Customers (words) are then seated with certain probability on either an occupied or a new table. The diagram below shows a depiction of this process. The parameter $\\phi_{k,t}$ on each table represents a topic-table ($k,t$ are topic and table indexes), and the customers represent the words. When a new customer (word) appears, it seated in either on a new or existing table. These decision are based on probabilities proportional to number of seated customers per table ($N$), overall customers seated, and the concentration parameter $\\alpha$. \n",
